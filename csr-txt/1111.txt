we live in a world where shopping encourages people to throw things away without even thinking twice about the environmental impact. simple things like a plastic bag that is used to carry goods from the local grocery store will be disposed as waste within a couple of hours and then taken to landfill. instead of it being recycled, a new bag will be created and it will go through the same life-cycle, which will continue to contribute to the problem.it’s frustrating for environmentalists because they can see the problem before their eyes, but unless people are prepared to see the value in making the necessary changes, it is unlikely that any changes will happen.however, there’s technology that you can shop for in 2017 that will make a difference. here are a few items that you should put on your shopping list, so you can do your part to preserve the environment.
