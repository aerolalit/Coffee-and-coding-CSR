here’s a funny story.â â when i crossed a union picket line to start work as a newswriting internâ at kttv-tv channel 11 in los angeles in 1981, the term “knowledge worker” had just entered the american lexicon (notably, alongside “sex worker”).â â asâ a fledgling tv newswriter, i was proud thatâ my tool was “knowledge.”â but when i got firedâ several months laterâ as theâ nabet unionâ came back to work andâ booted scabs like me, i suddenly feltâ moreâ likeâ an actual tool.âso,â like many boys who are tool-challenged, i went into advertising.first j. walter thompson, then chiat/day.â then,â becauseâ the ad bizâ taught me how and why people buy advertising, i decided that the real money was in selling it.â so i went into publishing.â and today, 23 publications, 10 conference businesses and 4 association management contracts later, i learned one truth:â becauseâ the time and effort it takes for a companyâ to sell stuff–their “sales cycle”–costs so much,â firms pay dearly for someone to gather crowds and shorten that painful cycle.â â andâ nothing gathers a crowd like a good storyâ or a lovelyâ 3-letter pro label.â the hro and croâ markets are the result.â âbut the story does not end withâ the hro and cro communities.â â both evolved becauseâ folks with a new job titleâ cravedâ a story and a nice logo, printed on glossy paper, that they could call their own.yetâ as it turns out,â glossy paper is soooo 1999.â â the new b2b reality is online, withâ linkedin and blogs and facebook and twitter… virtual environments thatâ have birthed a million mighty morphing micro-communities.â âif you really start digging, you’ll realize that the newâ musclemen of the micro-communityâ crowd are single-product or single-company user groups.â â they’re brand-mad, have money and they’re not afraid to use it.â these feature-and-function freaks–like loyal sports fans of the yankees or manchester united or canadiens or 49ers, they are loyal customers of apple and oracle and sap and taleo and harley-davidson and boeing and mattel and avon and sas and deere and ten thousand other brands.â they now represent some of the world’s most powerfulâ business armies, eclipsing the size and commercial power of industry trade shows, associationsâ and magazines.â and because electronic news can now travel so quickly among these well-wired communities, and loyalty-driving activities can be deployed widely and rapidly nearly for free, the value of such a group to shorten a company’s sales cycles is incalculably high.becauseâ user groupsâ are the ultimate testimony toâ a company’s powers of suggestion and seduction,â and sinceâ companiesâ payâ well, some of the world’s most talented story tellers are now employed at keeping user-group fansâ informed and enthusiatic.â â â and many more are focused on creating new user groups for new companies.âcorporate user groups are the new well-wired frontier for great story tellers.â owners of existing paper-based trade publications orâ terrestrial conferences be forewarned.â if your tenants include majorâ companies with their own sub-communities of raving fans, beware theâ power of those brand-boosting bands to wire themselves together and bypass you.â â â unless you show them the same twitter-frequent love they have for their pet brand, your weak ties will not bind them.â no matter how many times you send them a glossy brochure.â â jwes power is the energy brand embodying the sustainability, social and business ideals ofenvironmental solutions (asia) pte ltd.
