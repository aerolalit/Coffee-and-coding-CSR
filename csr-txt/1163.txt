2013 has been called the year of making history for our industry. clearly, it marked the beginning of a transformation throughout our nationâ€™s health care industry with the implementation of the affordable care act (aca). to prepare for the lawâ€™s requirement for most americans to have health insurance, we began working early in the year to form new community alliances as part of our commitment to make it easier for texas families to access affordable health care. part of our success in this effort was the result of the following two initiatives that helped us mobilize a record number of community partners as we prepared for unprecedented changes in the marketplace.be covered texas as the october deadline approached for the affordable care actâ€™s enrollment phase, blue cross and blue shield of texas was the first health insurer in the state to launch a statewide education and outreach initiative, called be covered texas (bct). the bct campaign, which is fully funded by bcbstx, focuses on helping the stateâ€™s uninsured population understand how the new health care law will impact them and what steps they need to take to gain access to individual health insurance. the bct campaign recruited more than 150 community partners statewide including established community groups, civic organizations, schools, religious institutions, and doctors to offer guidance and user-friendly educational materials in both english and spanish to help texans navigate the changes in the marketplace.healthy kids, healthy familiesâ®  in 2013, the company also showed our commitment to community by awarding more than $1.6 million in grants to 38 organizations across the state as part of our effort to stem the rising tide of obesity and chronic diseases. the grants are part of our healthy kids, healthy families (hkhf) initiative â€“ a signature program of blue cross and blue shield of texas that offers grants to community partners who understand their neighborhoods and have a track record of success in meeting the needs of their communities. we are committed to investing in organizations that offer sustainable, measurable programs to reach children and their families by focusing on four key areas: nutrition, physical activity, preventing and managing disease, and supporting safe environments.these two initiatives have been key to our success in 2013, but are just a sample of our outreach efforts. as you will see throughout our 2013 social responsibility report, our goal is to continue to foster community health improvements through alliances with local nonprofit organizations to offer programs that strengthen and enrich texas communities.a division of health care service corporation, a mutual legal reserve company, an independent licensee of the blue cross and blue shield association. | â© 2014 health care service corporation. all rights reserved.view social responsibility report for  hcscpowered by providence design. the use of site is governed by these terms of service and privacy policies
