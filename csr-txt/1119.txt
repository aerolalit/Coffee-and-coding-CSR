the network was formed in 2003 after the success of the first international conference on corporate social responsibility was held. since then we have continued to grow and there are currently around 600 members based all over the world. and we have continued to develop our activities in the areas of organising conferences and publishing. the main reason for the existence of the network however is to enable us as scholars concerned with various aspects of social responsibility to communicate with each other, share information, join together in research projects, develop courses and course material and various other activities.
